## File Integrity Checker – Python Project

Project Overview:

The File Integrity Checker is a simple yet effective Python tool developed to monitor changes in a specific file by calculating and comparing its SHA-256 hash value. A cryptographic hash is like a unique digital fingerprint for any file. Even a tiny change in the file's content will result in a completely different hash. This makes it a reliable way to check whether a file has been altered.

This tool was created using Python and executed using the Thonny IDE, which is specially designed for beginners. Thonny makes it easy to write, debug, and run Python scripts. Once the script was finalized, the code was uploaded to GitHub using the browser interface, making version control and sharing effortless. This project is perfect for students and beginners who want to learn practical applications of hashing and file security in Python.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python 3.11  
IDE/Editor: Thonny (lightweight, beginner-friendly)  
Operating System: Windows 10  
Hosting Platform: GitHub (using web upload)  
Python Library Used:
hashlib – for generating secure SHA-256 hash values  

Purpose of the Project:

The purpose of this project is to track file integrity by detecting any changes made to a file over time. This is important in many areas such as cybersecurity, backup verification, and digital forensics.

This project helps users to:

Monitor sensitive files for unauthorized edits  
Check if a file is the same before and after a backup  
Learn how hashing is applied in real-life security use cases  
Gain hands-on experience with file handling and Python scripting  
Understand data integrity and why it matters in computing

How It Works:

The user is prompted to enter the full path of the file they want to monitor.
The program calculates the **original SHA-256 hash** of the file.
The user is then asked to optionally make changes to the file.
After the user confirms, the script recalculates the hash.
It compares the new hash with the original one.
Based on the comparison, it tells the user whether the file was changed or remains the same.

Output Messages:

File is intact. No changes detected – when the file is unchanged  
WARNING: File has been modified – when the file content is different

Key Features:

Monitors the integrity of one file at a time  
Simple input and output interface using the terminal  
Easy to understand and execute, especially for beginners  
Uses only built-in Python libraries – no need to install extra packages  
Great introduction to hashing and file monitoring in cybersecurity

Use of This Project:-

This project is useful for:

Detecting if a file was edited or tampered with  
Protecting confidential or sensitive documents  
Verifying file integrity before or after backups  
Teaching and learning the importance of hashing in security  
Practicing Python file handling, user input, and logical operations

Conclusion:

This File Integrity Checker is a valuable project for learning and practical use. It demonstrates how hashing algorithms like SHA-256 can be used to verify the integrity of files. Built in **Thonny IDE** and hosted on GitHub, the project is both educational and functional. While it currently monitors a single file, it serves as a foundational project to understand how real-world file monitoring systems work. Beginners can use this as a starting point for more advanced tools and security projects.
